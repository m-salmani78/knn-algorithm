# KNN Classification with Iris Dataset

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks using the famous Iris dataset. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet effective method for classification that works by finding the K nearest data points in the feature space and assigning the majority class label among them to the query point.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each iris flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
